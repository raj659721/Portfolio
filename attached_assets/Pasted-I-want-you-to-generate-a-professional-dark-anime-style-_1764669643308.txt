I want you to generate a professional dark-anime style 3D developer character for my Hero section, inspired by the visual style and intensity of characters from Attack on Titan (but NOT an exact copy of Eren Yeager or any copyrighted character).

🎨 Character Requirements

A stylish anime-inspired male character

Sharp eyes, clean jawline, serious expression

Dark messy hair (anime style)

Clothing: simple dark jacket or hoodie

Semi-realistic lighting

Should look cool, mature, and professional, not cartoonish

💻 3D Requirements

Use:

React Three Fiber

@react-three/drei

Three.js

Vite + React

Generate a 3D head model or anime-inspired avatar that:

Can rotate slightly as the user's cursor moves

Has separate eyeball meshes for tracking

Has subtle head movement following cursor (not too much)

Features smooth & natural rotation, no snapping

Uses lerp for easing

Restricts movement so the eyes do not move unnaturally upward

🌟 Cursor Movement Improvements

Fix the “cursor up” movement problem:

Eye rotation must be limited vertically (e.g., -0.12 to 0.12 radians)

When cursor goes very high, cap the rotation to maintain realism

Head tilt should be minimal and smooth

Use damping on movement

Add acceleration + deceleration smoothing

🛠 Generate the following components:

Hero.jsx — layout with text on right side, 3D model on left

AnimeDeveloper.jsx — full 3D character model with:

head mesh

2 eye meshes

eye tracking logic

smoothed head rotation

ThreeScene.jsx (if needed)

Supporting hooks:

useMousePosition()

useSmoothFollow()

⚙️ Behavior Requirements

Map mouse to normalized device coordinates

Convert to small rotation values

Clamp movement (THREE.MathUtils.clamp)

Smooth using THREE.MathUtils.lerp

Make the character feel alive but not exaggerated

Add a subtle breathing animation

📝 Hero Text (right side)

“Hi, I'm Raj Suryavanshi”

“Full Stack Developer”

Short intro paragraph

🔥 Final Output Needed

Generate complete working code with all imports, components, and a fully functional AoT-inspired anime developer head whose eyes & head follow the cursor smoothly and realistically.
